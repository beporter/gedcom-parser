# GEDCOM Parser

Script to parse GEDCOM files into something I can use without getting another application (such as a CSV).

## Requirements

- [Ruby](./.ruby-version)
- Bundler

## Setup

1. `bundle install`
1. Download and set a sample GEDCOM file as `file.ged`.
1. Run `ruby gedcom_to_csv.rb` and see the CSV generate as `output.csv`

## Linting

`bundle exec rubocop -a *.rb`

## TODO

Everything, essentially.
